# MarketingTrendAnalyzer

MarketingTrendAnalyzer is a lightweight Python project designed to simulate, analyze, and predict marketing trends using historical sales data. This tool processes marketing data from the past 30 days and applies machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to forecast sales for the upcoming 7 days.

# Features
Data Simulation: Generates sample marketing data for the last 30 days to mimic real-world scenarios.

Trend Analysis: Analyzes historical sales trends to identify patterns and fluctuations in marketing performance.

Sales Prediction: Utilizes a linear regression model to predict future sales based on past data.

Easy to Use: Simple and clear Python code, suitable for beginners interested in marketing analytics and machine learning.

Extendable: Designed with modular code for easy customization and enhancement.

# How It Works
Data Generation: Simulates daily sales data over the last month.

# Model Training: Trains a linear regression model on the simulated data to learn the relationship between days and sales.

# Prediction: Uses the trained model to forecast sales for the next week.

# Output: Displays both the historical data trends and predicted sales values.
